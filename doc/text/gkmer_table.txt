Function

   Create an image showing all k-mer abundance within a sequence

Description

   This program creates an image showing the abundance of all k-mers
   (oligonucleotides of length k) in a given sequence. For example, for
   tetramers (k=4), resulting image is composed of 4^4 = 256 boxes, each
   representing an oligomer. Oligomer name and abundance is written within these
   boxes, and abundance is also visualized with the box color, from white (none)
   to black (highly frequent).

   This k-mer table is alternatively known as the FCGR (frequency matrices
   extracted from Chaos Game Representation).

   Position of the oligomers can be recursively located as follows:
   For each letter in an oligomer, a box is subdivided into four quadrants, 
   where A is upper left, T is lower right, G is upper right, and C is lower
   left.

   Therefore, oligomer ATGC is in the 
   A = upper left quadrant
   T = lower right within the above quadrant
   G = upper right within the above quadrant
   C = lower left within the above quadrant
