                                 gkmer_table
Function

   Create an image showing all k-mer abundance within a sequence

Description

   This program creates an image showing the abundance of all k-mers (oligonucleotides
   of length k) in a given sequence. For example, for tetramers (k=4), resulting image
   is composed of 4^4 = 256 boxes, each representing an oligomer. Oligomer name and 
   abundance is written within these boxes, and abundance is also visualized with 
   the box color, from white (none) to black (highly frequent).

   This k-mer table is alternatively known as the FCGR (frequency matrices extracted
   from Chaos Game Representation).

   Position of the oligomers can be recursively located as follows:
   For each letter in an oligomer, a box is subdivided into four quadrants, 
   where A is upper left, T is lower right, G is upper right, and C is lower left.
   Therefore, oligomer ATGC is in the 
   A = upper left quadrant
   T = lower right within the above quadrant
   G = upper right within the above quadrant
   C = lower left within the above quadrant

   With Google Maps representation using -gmap=>1 option, oligomers can be searched
   incrementally from the top search box.
