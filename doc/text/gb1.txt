Function

   Calculate strand bias of bacterial genome using B1 index

Description

   This method calculate strand bias of bacterial genome using B1 index,
   first proposed by Lobry and Sueoka (2002), and further extended by 
   Rocha et al. (2006). Basic idea of B1 index is to calculate the 
   distance between the two strands, when the leading and lagging strands
   are plotted in a coordinate system with axes representing G/(G+C) and A/(A+T),
   using the third codon position of genes. This index measures the degree of 
   replication-induced bias from Chargaff's second parity rule.

   Rocha et al. modified B1 index to only use >fourfold degenerate codons,
   and to use T/(A+T) in place of A/(A+T).
