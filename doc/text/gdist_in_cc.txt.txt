Function

   Calculates the distance between two loci in circular chromosomes

Description

   This program calculates the distance between two loci in 
   circular chromosomes, mostly useful to calculate the
   distance from the replication origin.

  
   G-language SOAP service is provided by the
   Institute for Advanced Biosciences, Keio University.
   The original web service is located at the following URL:

Usage

   Here is a sample session with gdist_in_cc

% gdist_in_cc NC_000913.gbk 1234
Calculates the distance between two loci in circular chromosomes
Output filename [nc_000913.gdist_in_cc]:

   Creates nc_000913.gdist_in_cc
   Output example is prepared in the data directory

   -secondposition     integer    [0] If the second position is not given,
                                  position of replication origin is used (Any
                                  integer value)
   -accid              string     Include to use sequence accession ID as
                                  query (Any string)
   -show               toggle     [N] Include to dump result to stdout
