Function

   Calculate the strength of selected codon usage bias (S)

Description

   This method calculates the strength of selected codon usage bias (S), also known
   as Sharp's S index. Using four codon pairs that are recognized by the same tRNA 
   anticodon, namely, Phe(UUC and UUU), Ile(AUC and AUU), Tyr(UAC and UAU), and 
   Asn(AAC and AAU), since the former in each of the pairs has stronger Watson-Crick
   pairing, selection towards the former codon can be observed for highly expressed 
   genes. S index is therefore the weighted average of such bias, giving an over-all
   value for a genome, indicating its strength of selected codon usage bias.
   See Reference 1 for details.

   Sharp originally defined 40 genes as the highly expressed gene group, with
   tufA, tsf, fusA, rplA-rplF, rplI-rplT, rpsB-rpsT. Since the identificaiton 
   of these genes is not convenient for computational automation, by default, 
   this method uses ribosomal proteins as the highly expressed gene group, 
   as used by Rocha and colleagues in Reference 2.

   However, Sharp's gene group can be optionally used with -sharp=>1 option.
   With this option, all of the 40 genes must be named accordingly in the given
   genome file.

Usage: 
    $s_value = S_value($genome);

  Options:
   -sharp           set to 1 to use the 40 genes used by Sharp instead of ribosomal proteins
                    (default: 0)
