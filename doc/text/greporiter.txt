Function

   Get the positions of replication origin and terminus

Description

   greporiter returns the positions of replication origin and terminus
   in bacterial genomes by several means. 

   1. Use of databases
   By default, grep_ori_ter tries to retrieve the position of replication
   origin in DoriC Gao and Zhang (2007) database, and the position of
   replication terminus from the supplemental data provided in
   Kono et al. (2011).
   If the position of origin cannot be found in the database, but "rep_origin" 
   feature is available, center position within this feature is used for
   origin. 

   2. Oriloc
   Using -orilocoption, you can predict the replication origin and 
   terminus using the popular Oriloc program developed by Lobry et al. 
   available as part of the SeqinR package Frank and Lobry (2000).

   3. Use GC skew shift-point
   If the positions of origin or terminus cannot be found in the databases,
   grep_ori_ter automatically calls find_ori_ter() method to predict the 
   positions using GC skew shift-points at one-base-pair resolution.
