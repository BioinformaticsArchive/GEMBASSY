Function

   Create a Chaos Game Representation of a given sequence

Description

   This program creates a Chaos Game Representation (CGR) image of a given sequence.

   CGR is generated by the following procedure:
   1. Start from position (0,0) or the origin of two dimensional coordinate.
   Four nucleotides are located at the four corners: 
   A: (-1, 1)  upper left
   T: (1, -1)  lower right
   G: (1, 1)   upper right
   C: (-1, -1) lower left
   2. For each nucleotide, move and mark the new location which is halfway between 
   the current location and the nucleotide. 
   For example, if the first letter is A, position is moved from (0,0) to 
   midpoint between (-1, 1) and (0,0), which is (-0.5, 0.5).
   3. Repeat this procedure for all nucleotides.

   CGR is a generalized scale-independent Markov probability table for the sequence, 
   and oligomer tables (see document for "kmer_table" function) can be deduced from CGR image.
