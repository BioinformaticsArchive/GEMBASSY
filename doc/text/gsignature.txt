                                   gsignature
Function

   Calculate oligonucleotide usage (genomic signature)

Description

   gsignature calculates short oligonuleotide usage (genomic signture),
   defined as the ratio of observed (O) to expected (E) oligonucleotide
   frequencies. It is known that the genomic signature stays constant
   throughout the genome.
