                                 gsignature
Function

   Calculate oligonucleotide usage (genomic signature)

Description

   This program calculates short oligonucleotide usage (genomic signature),
   defined as the ratio of observed (O) to expected (E) oligonucleotide
   frequencies. O/E value of dinucleotide CG will be accessible at 
   
   G-language SOAP service is provided by the
   Institute for Advanced Biosciences, Keio University.
   The original web service is located at the following URL:
