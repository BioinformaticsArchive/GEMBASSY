                                 gcodoncompiler
Function

   Calculate various kinds of amino acid and codon usage data

Description

   gcodoncompiler calculates various kinds of amino acid and codon usage data.
   The following values are calculable:
      A0: Absolute amino acid frequency
      A1: Relative amino acid frequency
      C0: Absolute codon frequency
      C1: Relative codon frequency in a complete sequence
      C2: Relative codon frequency in each amino acid
      C3: Relative synonymous codon usage
      C4: Relative adaptiveness
      C5: Maximum or minor codon
   For amino acids unpresent in a gene, C2-C3 does not calculate the values.
   By using R* in place, such values are hypothesized that alternative
   synonymous codons are used with equal frequency.
