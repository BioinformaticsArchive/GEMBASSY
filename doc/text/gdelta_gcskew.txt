Function

   Calculate strand bias of bacterial genome using delta GC skew index

Description

   This method calculate strand bias of bacterial genome using delta GC skew
   index, first proposed by Rocha et al. (2001), and further extended in 2006.
   Basic idea of delta GC skew index is to calculate the difference of GC skew
   in coding regions residing in leading and lagging strands. Rocha et al.
   (2001) calculates delta GC skew index using the third codon position of
   genes, and Rocha et al. (2006)  modified to only use >fourfold degenerate
   codons.
