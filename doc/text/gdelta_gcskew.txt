Function

   Calculate strand bias of bacterial genome using delta GC skew index

Description

   This method calculate strand bias of bacterial genome using delta GC skew index,
   first proposed by Rocha et al in Reference 1, and further extended   in Reference 2. Basic idea of delta GC skew index is to calculate the 
   difference of GC skew in coding regions residing in leading and lagging strands.
   Reference 1 calculates delta GC skew index using the third codon position of genes,
   and Reference 2  modified to only use >fourfold degenerate codons.

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers: (none)
   Advanced (Unprompted) qualifiers:
   -at                 boolean    [0] '1' when observing AT skew instead of GC
                                  skew
   -purine             boolean    [0] '1' when observing purine (AG/TC) skew
   -keto               boolean    [0] '1' when observing keto (TG/AC) skew
   -method             string     [degenerate] Choose the nucleotides to use
                                  'degenerate', 'gc3', or 'all' (Any string)
   -accid              boolean    [0] Include to use sequence accession ID as
                                  query

   General qualifiers:
   -help               boolean    Report command line options and exit. More
                                  information on associated and general
                                  qualifiers can be found with -help -verbose
