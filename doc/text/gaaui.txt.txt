Function

   Calculates various indece of amino acid usage

Description

   This program calculates amino acid usage indices for proteins
   (excluding formylmethionine).

  
   G-language SOAP service is provided by the
   Institute for Advanced Biosciences, Keio University.
   The original web service is located at the following URL:

   http://www.g-language.org/wiki/soap

   WSDL(RPC/Encoded) file is located at:

   http://soap.g-language.org/g-language.wsdl

   Documentation on G-language Genome Analysis Environment methods are
   provided at the Document Center

Usage

   Here is a sample session with gaaui

% gaaui NC_000913.gbk
Calculates various indece of amino acid usage
Output filename [nc_000913.gaaui]:

   Creates nc_000913.gaaui
   Output example is prepared in the data directory
