Function

   Searches oligomers in given sequence

Description

   Searches for the given oligomer in given sequence. Oligomer can be 
   specified using degenerate nucleotide alphabet, or by regular expressions.
   Performance is optimized for fast searching.

   This method changes the returning value according to the given options.
