                                goligomersearch
Function

   Searches oligomers in given sequence

Description

   goligomersearch searches for the given oligomer in given sequence. Oligomer
   can be specified using degenerate nucleotide alphabet, or by regular
   expressions. Performance is optimized for fast searching.
   This method changes the returning value according to the given options.
