Function

   Calculate codon adaptation index for each gene

Description

   This program calculates codon adaptation index (CAI) for each gene.

  
   G-language SOAP service is provided by the
   Institute for Advanced Biosciences, Keio University.
   The original web service is located at the following URL:

   http://www.g-language.org/wiki/soap

   WSDL(RPC/Encoded) file is located at:

   http://soap.g-language.org/g-language.wsdl

   Documentation on G-language Genome Analysis Environment methods are
   provided at the Document Center

   http://ws.g-language.org/gdoc/

Usage

   Here is a sample session with gcai

% gcai NC_000913.gbk
Calculate codon adaptation index for each gene
Output filename [gcai.nc_000913.csv]:

   Creates gcai.nc_000913.csv

Command line arguments

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          seqall     Nucleotide sequence(s) filename and optional
                                  format, or reference (input USA)
   -outfile            outfile    [gcai.$(sequence.name).csv] Output file name

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers: (none)
   Advanced (Unprompted) qualifiers:
   -translate          boolean    [0] Include when translating using standard
                                  codon table
   -wabsent            string     [-] W value of codons absent from a
                                  reference set '-' when excludes such codons
                                  from the calculation (Any string)
   -accid              string     Include to use sequence accession ID as
                                  query (Any string)

   General qualifiers:
   -help               boolean    Report command line options and exit. More
                                  information on associated and general
                                  qualifiers can be found with -help -verbose
