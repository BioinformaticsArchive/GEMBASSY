Function

   Calculates and graphs the sequence conservation using Shanon uncertainty (entropy)

Description

   This function calculates and graphs the sequence conservation in regions 
   around the start/stop codons using Shanon uncertainty (entropy).

Usage

   Here is a sample session with gbase_entropy

% gbase_entropy -plotNC_000913.gbk
Calculates and graphs the sequence conservation using Shanon uncertainty (entropy)
Output filename [nc_000913.gbase_entropy]:Error: Failed to open filename '-plotNC_000913.gbk'
Error: Unable to read sequence '-plotNC_000913.gbk'
Died: gbase_entropy terminated: Bad value for '-sequence' with -auto defined


   Creates nc_000913.gbase_entropy
   Output example is prepared in the data directory
