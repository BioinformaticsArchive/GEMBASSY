                                gconsensus_z
Function

   Calculate consensus in given array of sequences

Description

   Calculates the consensus of given list of sequences, using Z-score.
   Consensus with Z value greater than int high_z (default is 1) is 
   capitalized, and consensus with Z value less than int low_z 
   (default is 0.2) is shown as '-'.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with gconsensus_z

% gconsensus_z  -plotconsensus.fasta -graph cps
Calculate consensus in given array of sequences
Output filename [*.gconsensus_z]:Error: Failed to open filename '-plotconsensus.fasta'
Error: Unable to read sequence '-plotconsensus.fasta'
Died: gconsensus_z terminated: Bad value for '-sequence' with -auto defined



   Creates *.gconsensus_z
   Output example is prepared in the data directory
