Function

   Calculate strand bias of bacterial genome using B2 index

Description

   This method calculate strand bias of bacterial genome using B2 index,
   proposed by Lobry and Sueoka in Reference 1. Basic idea of B2 index is 
   to calculate the distance from neutral parity state (0.5, 0.5), when the bias of
   the coding regions is plotted in a coordinate system with axes representing 
   G/(G+C) and A/(A+T), using the third codon position of genes. This index measures 
   the degree of transcription- and translation-associated effects of bias from 
   Chargaff's second parity rule.
