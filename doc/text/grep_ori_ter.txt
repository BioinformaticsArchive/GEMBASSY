Function

   Get the positions of replication origin and terminus

Description

   This method returns the positions of replication origin and terminus
   in bacterial genomes by several means. 

   1. Use of databases
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
     By default, rep_ori_ter() tries to retrieve the position of replication
     origin in DoriC (Gao and Zhang, 2007) database, and the position of
     replication terminus from the supplemental data provided in
     (Kono et al., 2011).

     If the position of origin cannot be found in the database, but
     "rep_origin" feature is available, center position within this feature
     is used for origin. 

   2. Oriloc
     Using -oriloc 1 option, you can predict the replication origin and 
     terminus using the popular Oriloc program developed by Lobry et al. 
     available as part of the SeqinR package (Frank and Lobry, 2000).

   3. Use GC skew shift-point
      If the positions of origin or terminus cannot be found in the databases,
      rep_ori_ter() automatically calls find_ori_ter() method to predict the 
      positions using GC skew shift-points at one-base-pair resolution.

=======
   By default, rep_ori_ter() tries to retrieve the position of replication
   origin in DoriC (Reference 1) database, and the position of replication
   terminus from the supplemental data provided in Reference 2.
=======
     By default, grep_ori_ter tries to retrieve the position of replication
     origin in DoriC Gao and Zhang (2007) database, and the position of
     replication terminus from the supplemental data provided in Kono et al.
     (2011).

   If the position of origin cannot be found in the database, but "rep_origin" 
   feature is available, center position within this feature is used for origin. 

   2. Oriloc
   Using -oriloc=>1 option, you can predict the replication origin and 
   terminus using the popular Oriloc program developed by Lobry et al. 
   available as part of the SeqinR package (Reference 3).

   Installation of SeqinR package is required to use this feature.
   Type: install.packages('seqinr', dep=T)
   in R statistics package to install SeqinR.

   3. Setting custom origin and terminus
   Use -ori=>$position1, -ter=>$position2 to set your own positions.

   4. Use GC skew shift-point
   If the positions of origin or terminus cannot be found in the databases,
   rep_ori_ter() automatically calls find_ori_ter() method to predict the 
   positions using GC skew shift-points at one-base-pair resolution.

   After calling this function, positions of origin and terminus are stored 
   as follows:
   $genome->{FEATURE0}->{origin}
   $genome->{FEATURE0}->{terminus}

   You can always use -clear=>1 option to disable the use of above cache.
