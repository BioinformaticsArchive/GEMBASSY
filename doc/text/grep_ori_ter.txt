                                  grep_ori_ter
Function

   Get the positions of replication origin and terminus

Description

   This method returns the positions of replication origin and terminus
   in bacterial genomes by several means. 

   1. Use of databases
   By default, grep_ori_ter tries to retrieve the position of replication
   origin in DoriC Gao and Zhang (2007) database, and the position of
   replication terminus from the supplemental data provided in
   Kono et al. (2011).

   If the position of origin cannot be found in the database, but "rep_origin" 
   feature is available, center position within this feature is used for origin. 
   2. Oriloc
   Using -orilocoption, you can predict the replication origin and 
   terminus using the popular Oriloc program developed by Lobry et al. 
   available as part of the SeqinR package Frank and Lobry (2000).

   3. Setting custom origin and terminus
   Use -ori position1, -ter position2 to set your own positions.

   4. Use GC skew shift-point
   If the positions of origin or terminus cannot be found in the databases,
   grep_ori_ter automatically calls find_ori_ter() method to predict the 
   positions using GC skew shift-points at one-base-pair resolution.

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers: (none)
   Advanced (Unprompted) qualifiers:
   -oriloc             boolean    [0] Set to 1 to use Oriloc for prediction
   -gcskew             boolean    [0] Set to 1 to use GC skew shift-point for
                                  prediction
   -difthreshold       integer    [0] Distance between the GC skew shift point
                                  and predicted dif site expressed as the
                                  precentage of genome size, used as a
                                  threshold to retrieve dif sequence from the
                                  database (Any integer value)
   -dbonly             boolean    [0] Set to 1 to only use values available in
                                  databases and to suppress prediction
   -accid              string     Include to use sequence accession ID as
                                  query (Any string)
   -show               toggle     [N] Include to dump result to stdout

   General qualifiers:
   -help               boolean    Report command line options and exit. More
                                  information on associated and general
                                  qualifiers can be found with -help -verbose
