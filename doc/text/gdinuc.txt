Function

   Calculates dinucleotide usage

Description

   gdinuc calculates dinucleotide usage indices for protein-coding sequences
   (excluding start and stop codons). Dinucleotide usage is computed as the
   ratio of observed (O) to expected (E) dinucleotide frequencies within the
   given sequence. Dinucleotides are known to have consistent patterns within
   the genome (signatures) and tend to have certain periodicities.
