Function

   Calculates dinucleotide usage 

Description

   This program calculates dinucleotide usage indices for protein-coding
   sequences (excluding start and stop codons).
   Dinucleotide usage was computed as the ratio of observed (O) to expected (E) 
   dinucleotide frequencies.

   G-language SOAP service is provided by the
   Institute for Advanced Biosciences, Keio University.
   The original web service is located at the following URL:

   WSDL(RPC/Encoded) file is located at:

   http://soap.g-language.org/g-language.wsdl

   Documentation on G-language Genome Analysis Environment methods are
   provided at the Document Center
