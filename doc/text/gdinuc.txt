                                   gdinuc
Function

   Calculates dinucleotide usage 

Description

   This program calculates dinucleotide usage indices for protein-coding sequences
   (excluding start and stop codons), and inputs in the G instance. e.g. CG dinucleotide 
   usage at the reading frame 1-2 will be accessible at $gb->{"FEATURE$i"}->{cg12}
   Dinucleotide usage was computed as the ratio of observed (O) to expected (E) 
   dinucleotide frequencies.
   Informations stored in the G instance are: $gb->{header_dinuc}

 
   G-language SOAP service is provided by the
