                                   gdinuc
Function

   Calculates dinucleotide usage 

Description

   This program calculates dinucleotide usage indices for protein-coding
   sequences (excluding start and stop codons).
   Dinucleotide usage was computed as the ratio of observed (O) to expected (E) 
   dinucleotide frequencies.
