Function

   Calculate strand bias of bacterial genome using linear discriminant analysis
   (LDA)

Description

   This method calculate strand bias of bacterial genome using linear
   discriminant analysis (LDA), as proposed in Reference 1. The basic idea is to
   use composition data of genes to train and predict the strand of genes
   residing either on the leading or the lagging strand. For computational
   efficiency, this method trans and predicts the strands at putative
   replication origin as reported by the rep_ori_ter() method. This usually
   results in maximum predictability of LDA within bacterial genomes.

   Data to use for LDA can be chosen from "base", "codonbase", "codon", and
   "amino", with -variable option.
