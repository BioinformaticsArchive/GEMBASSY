Function

   Calculate strand bias of bacterial genome using linear discriminant analysis (LDA)

Description

   This method calculate strand bias of bacterial genome using linear discriminant 
   analysis (LDA), as proposed in Reference 1. The basic idea is to use composition
   data of genes to train and predict the strand of genes residing either on the 
   leading or the lagging strand. For computational efficiency, this method trans
   and predicts the strands at putative replication origin as reported by the 
   rep_ori_ter() method. This usually results in maximum predictability of LDA
   within bacterial genomes.

   Data to use for LDA can be chosen from "base", "codonbase", "codon", and "amino",
   with -variable option.

   Installation of R statistics package is required.
