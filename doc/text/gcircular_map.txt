Function

   Draws circular map of the genome 

Description

   This method creates a circular map of the genome using SVG,
   suitable for plasmids and circular bacterial chromosomes.

   From the outer ring inwards, genes on direct strand (pink), 
   genes on complementary strand (yellow), tRNAs (green arrows), 
   rRNAs (pink or orange stripes depending on the strand), 
   GC content (brown lines), GC skew (yellow lines). Replication 
   origin and terminus predicted from the GC skew shift points 
   are also labeled.
