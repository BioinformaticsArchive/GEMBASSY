Function

   Calculate strand bias of bacterial genome using linear discriminant

Description

   gldabias calculates strand bias of bacterial genome using linear
   discriminant analysis (LDA), as proposed in Reference 1. The basic idea is
   to use composition data of genes to train and predict the strand of genes
   residing either on the leading or the lagging strand. For computational
   efficiency, this method trans and predicts the strands at putative
   replication origin as reported by the rep_ori_ter() method. This usually
   results in maximum predictability of LDA within bacterial genomes.
   Data to use for LDA can be chosen from "base", "codonbase", "codon", and
   "amino", with -variable option.
