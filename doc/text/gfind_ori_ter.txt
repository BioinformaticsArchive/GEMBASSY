Function

   Predict the replication origin and terminus in bacterial genomes

Description

   Predicts the replicational origin and terminus in circular bacterial genomes,
   by taking the vertices of cumulative skew graphs (GC, keto, or purine). See
<<<<<<< HEAD
   (Frank and Lobry, 2000) for the basic idea behind this algorithm
   (but also note that this algorithm is different from that of Oriloc, which
   uses GC3 of genes). 

   Terminus of replication can be more accurate by using noise-reduction 
   filtering using Fourier spectrum of the GC skew. This low-pass filtering
   can be applied using -filter option. See (Arakawa et al., 2007) for details.

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers: (none)
   Advanced (Unprompted) qualifiers:
   -window             integer    [4096] Number of windows to use for Fat
                                  Fourier Transform. Only active when -filter
                                  option is specified. Value must be the power
                                  of two (Any integer value)
   -purine             boolean    [0] Use purine skew for calculation
   -keto               boolean    [0] Use keto skew for calculation
   -filt               integer    [0] Lowpass filter strength in percent.
                                  Typically 95 or 99 works best (Any integer
