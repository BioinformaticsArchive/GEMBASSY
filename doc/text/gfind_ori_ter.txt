Function

   Predict the replication origin and terminus in bacterial genomes

Description

   Predicts the replicational origin and terminus in circular bacterial genomes,
   by taking the vertices of cumulative skew graphs (GC, keto, or purine). See
   Frank and Lobry (2000) for the basic idea behind thid algorithm (but also
   note that this algorithm is different from that of Oriloc, which uses GC3 of
   genes). 

   Terminus of replication can be more accurate by using noise-reduction 
   filtering using Fourier spectrum of the GC skew. This low-pass filtering
   can be applied using -filter option. See Arakawa et al. (2007) for details.

Command line arguments

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers (* if not always prompted):
  [-sequence]          seqall     Nucleotide sequence(s) filename and optional
                                  format, or reference (input USA)
*  -outfile            outfile    [*.gfind_ori_ter] Output file name

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers: (none)
   Advanced (Unprompted) qualifiers:
   -window             integer    [4096] Number of windows to use for Fat
                                  Fourier Transform. Only active when -filter
                                  option is specified. Value must be the power
                                  of two (Any integer value)
   -purine             boolean    [0] Use purine skew for calculation
   -keto               boolean    [0] Use keto skew for calculation
   -filt               integer    [0] Lowpass filter strength in percent.
                                  Typically 95 or 99 works best (Any integer
                                  value)
   -accid              string     Include to use sequence accession ID as
                                  query (Any string)
   -show               toggle     [N] Include to dump result to stdout

   General qualifiers:
   -help               boolean    Report command line options and exit. More
                                  information on associated and general
                                  qualifiers can be found with -help -verbose
