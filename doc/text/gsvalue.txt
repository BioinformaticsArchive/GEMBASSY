Function

   Calculate the strength of selected codon usage bias (S)

Description

   gsvalue calculates the strength of selected codon usage bias (S), also
   known as Sharp's S index. Using four codon pairs that are recognized by the
   same tRNA anticodon, namely, Phe(UUC and UUU), Ile(AUC and AUU), Tyr(UAC and
   UAU), and Asn(AAC and AAU), since the former in each of the pairs has
   stronger Watson-Crick pairing, selection towards the former codon can be
   observed for highly expressed genes. S index is therefore the weighted
   average of such bias, giving an over-all value for a genome, indicating its
   strength of selected codon usage bias. See Sharp et al. (2005) for details.
   Sharp originally defined 40 genes as the highly expressed gene group, with
   tufA, tsf, fusA, rplA-rplF, rplI-rplT, rpsB-rpsT. Since the identificaiton
   of these genes is not convenient for computational automation, by default,
   this method uses ribosomal proteins as the highly expressed gene group,
   as used by Viera-silva and Rocha (2010).
   However, Sharp's gene group can be optionally used with -sharp option.
   With this option, all of the 40 genes must be named accordingly in the given
   genome file.
