Function

   Identify predicted highly expressed (PHX) genes

Description

   This program calculates codon usage differences between gene classes for
   identifying predicted highly expressed (PHX) genes.

   This program downloads the result file to the working directory.
   The downloaded file is named "gphx.csv".

   G-language SOAP service is provided by the
   Institute for Advanced Biosciences, Keio University.
   The original web service is located at the following URL:

   http://www.g-language.org/wiki/soap

   WSDL(RPC/Encoded) file is located at:

   http://soap.g-language.org/g-language.wsdl

   Documentation on G-language Genome Analysis Environment methods are
   provided at the Document Center

   http://ws.g-language.org/gdoc/

Usage

   Here is a sample session with gphx
