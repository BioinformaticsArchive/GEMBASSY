Function

   Identify predicted highly expressed gene

Description

   gphx calculates codon usage differences between gene classes for identifying
   Predicted Highly eXpressed (PHX) and Putative Alien (PA) genes. A gene is
   identified as PHX if BgC/BgH >= 1, where BgC and BgH is a value < 1 by it's
   nature. PHX genes are known to generally have favorable codon usage, strong
   SD sequences, and probably stronger conservation of promoter sequences.
   A gene is idenfitied as PA if BgC and BgH is greater than the median of
   BgC for every gene with a length close to the gene.
