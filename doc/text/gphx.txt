Function

   Identify predicted highly expressed gene

Description

   This program calculates codon usage differences between gene classes for
   identifying Predicted Highly eXpressed (PHX) and Putative Alien (PA) genes.
   The "expression measure" of a gene, E_g, will be accessible at
   $gb->{"FEATURE$i"}->{E_g}.

Usage:
    NULL = &phx(G instance);

  Options:
   -output      output option (default: 'show')
                'stdout' for standard output,
                'f' for file output in directory "data",
                'g' for graph output in directory "graph",
                'show' for graph output and display (default: "show")
   -filename    output filename (default: "phx.png" for -output=>"g",
                                          "phx.csv" for -output=>"f")
   -usage       pointer HASH of vectors of amino acid and codon
