                                   gaminoinfo
Function

   Prints out basic amino acid sequence statistics

Description

   gaminoinfo prints out basic compositional statistics of the given amino
   acid sequence in a human readble manner. The calculated values are molecular
   weight, number of residues, average residue weight, charge, isoelectric
   point, number/mole/Dayhoffstat of each amino acid, and percentage of
   Tiny (A+C+G+S+T), Small (A+B+C+D+G+N+P+S+T+V), Aliphatic (I+L+V),
   Armoatic (F+H+W+Y), Non-polar (A+C+F+G+I+L+M+P+V+W+Y),
   Polar (D+E+H+K+N+Q+R+S+T+Z), Charged (B+D+E+H+K+R+Z), Basic (H+K+R), and
   Acidic (B+D+E+Z) reidues.
