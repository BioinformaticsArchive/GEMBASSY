Function

   Predict the replication origin and terminus in bacterial genomes

Description

   gfindoriter predicts the replicational origin and terminus in circular
   bacterial genomes, by taking the vertices of cumulative skew graphs (GC,
   d keto, or purine). See Frank and Lobry (2000) for the basic idea behind
   this algorithm (but also note that this algorithm is different from that
   of Oriloc, which uses GC3 of genes). 
   Terminus of replication can be more accurate by using noise-reduction 
   filtering using Fourier spectrum of the GC skew. This low-pass filtering
   can be applied using -filter option. See Arakawa et al. (2007) for details.
