                                     gp2
Function

   Calculate the P2 index of each gene

Description

   This program calculates the P2 index for each gene. This index describes the 
   proportion of codons conforming to the intermediate strength of codon-anticodon 
   interaction energy rule of Grosjean and Fiers: P2 = (WWC+SSU)/(WWY+SSY) 
   where W = A or U, S = C or G, and Y = C or U.
   P2 values will be accessible at $gb->{"FEATURE$i"}->{P2};
