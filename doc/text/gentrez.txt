Function

   Search NCBI Entrez in G-language Shell

Description

   Search NCBI Entrez with keyword through EUtilities. 
   This is intended for quick lookup through G-language Shell, 
   so only top ten hits are reported.

  
   G-language SOAP service is provided by the
   Institute for Advanced Biosciences, Keio University.
   The original web service is located at the following URL:

   http://www.g-language.org/wiki/soap

   WSDL(RPC/Encoded) file is located at:

   http://soap.g-language.org/g-language.wsdl

   Documentation on G-language Genome Analysis Environment methods are
   provided at the Document Center

   http://ws.g-language.org/gdoc/
