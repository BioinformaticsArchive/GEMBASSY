   Search NCBI Entrez in G-language Shell

Description

   Search NCBI Entrez with keyword through EUtilities. 
   This is intended for quick lookup through G-language Shell, 
   so only top ten hits are reported.

  
   G-language SOAP service is provided by the
   Institute for Advanced Biosciences, Keio University.
   The original web service is located at the following URL:
