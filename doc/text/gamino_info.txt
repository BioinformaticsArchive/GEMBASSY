Function

   Prints out basic amino acid sequence statistics

Description

   This method prints out basic compositional statistics of the 
   given amino acid sequence in a human readable manner.

   Displayed information includes the following:
   Molecular weight, number of residues, average residue weight, charge,
   isoelectric point, number/mole/DayhoffStat of each amino acid, and
   percentage of Tiny (A+C+G+S+T), Small (A+B+C+D+G+N+P+S+T+V), 
   Aliphatic (I+L+V), Aromatic (F+H+W+Y), Non-polar (A+C+F+G+I+L+M+P+V+W+Y), 
   Polar (D+E+H+K+N+Q+R+S+T+Z), Charged (B+D+E+H+K+R+Z), Basic (H+K+R),
   Acidic (B+D+E+Z) residues.
