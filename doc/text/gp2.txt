                                      gp2
Function

   Calculate the P2 index of each gene

Description

   gp2 calculates the P2 index for each gene. This index describes
   the proportion of codons conforming to the intermediate strength of
   codon-anticodon interaction energy rule of Grosjean and Fiers:
   P2 = (WWC+SSU)/(WWY+SSY) where W = A or U, S = C or G, and Y = C or U.
   It indicates the efficiency of the codon-anticodon interaction, and has
   been used as an indicator of the presence of translational selection.
