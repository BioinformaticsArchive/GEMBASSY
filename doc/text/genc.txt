Function

   Calculate the effective number of codons (Nc)

Description

   This program calculates the effective number of codons (Nc).

  
   G-language SOAP service is provided by the
   Institute for Advanced Biosciences, Keio University.
   The original web service is located at the following URL:

   http://www.g-language.org/wiki/soap

   WSDL(RPC/Encoded) file is located at:

   http://soap.g-language.org/g-language.wsdl

   Documentation on G-language Genome Analysis Environment methods are
   provided at the Document Center

   http://ws.g-language.org/gdoc/

Usage

   Here is a sample session with genc

   The database definitions for following commands are available at
   http://soap.g-language.org/kbws/embossrc

% genc -show refseqn:NC_000913
Calculate the effective number of codons (Nc)
Output filename [nc_000913.genc]:
Sequence: NC_000913 ENC: 49.44

Command line arguments

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers (* if not always prompted):
  [-sequence]          seqall     Nucleotide sequence(s) filename and optional
                                  format, or reference (input USA)
*  -outfile            outfile    [*.genc] Output file name

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers: (none)
   Advanced (Unprompted) qualifiers:
   -translate          boolean    [0] Include when translates using standard
                                  codon table
   -id                 string     [All] ID of a group of genes or a single
                                  gene (Any string)
   -delkey             string     [[^ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWYacgtU]] Regular
                                  expression to delete key (i.e. amino acids
                                  and nucleotides) (Any string)
   -accid              string     Include to use sequence accession ID as
                                  query (Any string)
   -show               toggle     [N] Include to dump result to stdout

   General qualifiers:
   -help               boolean    Report command line options and exit. More
                                  information on associated and general
                                  qualifiers can be found with -help -verbose
