Function

   Calculate the effective number of codons (Nc)

Description

   genc calculates the effective number of codons (ENC|Nc). ENC is a measure
   for species-independent codon usage bias. Some measures including CAI are
   species-dependent as optimal codons differ. ENC assigns a gene a number
   between 20 to 61 where 20 indicates that one codon is used for each amino
   acid and 61 indicates that each codon is used equally throughout the
   protein sequence.
