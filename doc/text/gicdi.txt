Function

   Calculates the intrinsic codon deviation index (ICDI)

Description

   gicdi calculates the intrinsic codon deviation index (ICDI).
   ICDI is a measure to estimate codon bias of genes from species in which
   optimal codons are not known. It is known to show high correlation with
   other indices such as CBI and ENC.
