Function

   Calculate the codon usage bias related to translation optimization (delta ENC)

Description

   This method calculates the codon usage bias related to translation optimization 
   (delta ENC) described in Reference 1. The basic idea is to calculate the Effective
   Number of Codons (ENC) for highly-expressed genes (ribosomal genes) and weakly-
   expressed genes (all genes), and taking the relative difference between them.

Usage: 
    $delta_enc = delta_enc($genome);

  Options:
    None.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with gdelta_enc

% gdelta_enc -show refseqn:NC_000913
