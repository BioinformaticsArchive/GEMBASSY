Function

   Draws DNA Walk map of the genome

Description

   gdnawalk draws the DNA Walk map of the given genome. DNA Walk is drawn by
   moving a single pixel per nucleotide, in the direction specified for each
   base. Here A is moved upward, T downward, G to the right, and C to the
   left. Position zero (first letter of the genome) is indicated by the
   crossing of thin axes.
    
   G-language SOAP service is provided by the
   Institute for Advanced Biosciences, Keio University.
   The original web service is located at the following URL:

   WSDL(RPC/Encoded) file is located at:

   http://soap.g-language.org/g-language.wsdl
