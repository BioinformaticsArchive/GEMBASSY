                                    gwvalue
Function

   Calculate the 'relative adaptiveness of each codon' (W)

Description

   gwvalue calculates the 'relative adaptiveness of each codon' (W value)
   which is essential in CAI analysis. W value is calculated by setting the
   best codon to 1 and calculating the proportion of the other codons.
