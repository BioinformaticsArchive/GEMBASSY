Function

   Get the sequences of leading strands

Description

   This method returns the leading strands from origin and terminus 
   of replication calculated with rep_ori_ter().

   When called in array context, this method returns the sequences
   of the two replication arms. In scalar context, the sequences of
   the two arms are concatenated and returned as one sequence.
