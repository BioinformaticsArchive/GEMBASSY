Function

   Calculates the GC skew of the input sequence

Description

   This program calculates and graphs the GC skew. 
 
   G-language SOAP service is provided by the
   Institute for Advanced Biosciences, Keio University.
   The original web service is located at the following URL:

   http://www.g-language.org/wiki/soap

   WSDL(RPC/Encoded) file is located at:

   http://soap.g-language.org/g-language.wsdl

   Documentation on G-language Genome Analysis Environment methods are
   provided at the Document Center

                                  name

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers: (none)
   Advanced (Unprompted) qualifiers:
   -window             integer    [10000] Window size to observe (Any integer

                                  value)
   -cumulative         boolean    [0] Include to calculate cumulative skew
   -at                 boolean    [0] Include for observing AT skew instead of
                                  GC skew
   -purine             boolean    [0] Include for observing purine (AG/TC)
                                  skew
   -keto               boolean    [0] Include for observing keto (TG/AC) skew
   -accid              string     Include to use sequence accession ID as
                                  query (Any string)
   -plot               toggle     [N] Include to plot result
