Function

   Calculates the GC skew of the input sequence

Description

   ggcskew calculates and plots the GC skew of the given sequence. The "skew"
   of a sequence is calculated as (C-G)/(C+G) in GC skew. The program can
   alternatively calculate AT skew, purine skew, and keto skew, as well as
   cumulative skew. GC skew is used to observe various biological aspects
   such as prediction of replication origin and terminus in bacteria.
