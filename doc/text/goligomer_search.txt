                              goligomer_search
Function

   Searches oligomers in given sequence

Description

   Searches for the given oligomer in given sequence. Oligomer can be 
   specified using degenerate nucleotide alphabet, or by regular expressions.
   Performance is optimized for fast searching.

   This method changes the returning value according to the given options.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with goligomer_search

% goligomer_search  NC_000913.gbk atgcatgc
Searches oligomers in given sequence
Output filename [*.goligomer_search]:


   Creates *.goligomer_search
   Output example is prepared in the data directory

Command line arguments

Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers (* if not always prompted):
  [-sequence]          seqall     Nucleotide sequence(s) filename and optional
                                  format, or reference (input USA)
  [-oligomer]          string     Oligomer to search (Any string)
*  -outfile            outfile    [*.goligomer_search] Output file name

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers: (none)
   Advanced (Unprompted) qualifiers:
   -return             string     [position] 'position"' to return list of
                                  positions where oligomers are found, 'oligo'
                                  to return list of oligomers found ordered
                                  by positions, 'both' to return a hash with
                                  positions as keys and oligomers as values,
                                  'distribution' to return four values (see
                                  above) about the distribution of given
                                  oligomer (Any string)
   -accid              string     Include to use sequence accession ID as
                                  query (Any string)
   -show               toggle     [N] Include to dump result to stdout

   General qualifiers:
   -help               boolean    Report command line options and exit. More
                                  information on associated and general
                                  qualifiers can be found with -help -verbose
