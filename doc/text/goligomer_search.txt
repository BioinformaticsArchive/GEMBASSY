                              goligomer_search
Function

   Searches oligomers in given sequence

Description

   Searches for the given oligomer in given sequence. Oligomer can be 
   specified using degenerate nucleotide alphabet, or by regular expressions.
   Performance is optimized for fast searching.

Command line arguments

Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          seqall     Nucleotide sequence(s) filename and optional
                                  format, or reference (input USA)
  [-oligomer]          string     Oligomer to search (Any string)

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers: (none)
   Advanced (Unprompted) qualifiers:
   -return             string     [position] 'position"' to return list of
                                  positions where oligomers are found, 'oligo'
                                  to return list of oligomers found ordered
                                  by positions, 'both' to return a hash with
                                  positions as keys and oligomers as values,
                                  'distribution' to return four values (see
                                  above) about the distribution of given
                                  oligomer (Any string)
   -accid              string     Include to use sequence accession ID as
                                  query (Any string)

   General qualifiers:
   -help               boolean    Report command line options and exit. More
