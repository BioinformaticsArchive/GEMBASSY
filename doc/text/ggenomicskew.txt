Function

   Calculates the GC skew in different regions of the given genome

Description

   ggenomicskew calculates and plots the GC skew for the whole genome, coding
   regions, intergenic regions, and the third codon. This program is useful in
   visualizing various base composition bias within the genome. AT skew can be
   calculated instead of GC skew by toggling the -at qualifier.
