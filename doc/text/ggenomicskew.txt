Function

   Calculates the GC skew in different regions of the given genome

Description

   This program graphs the GC skew for the whole genome, coding regions,
   intergenic regions, and the third codon.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with ggenomicskew

% ggenomicskew  NC_000913.gbk -graph cps
Calculates the GC skew in different regions of the given genome
Created ggenomicskew.ps

   Creates ggenomicskew.[accession].ps
   Output example is prepared in the data directory
