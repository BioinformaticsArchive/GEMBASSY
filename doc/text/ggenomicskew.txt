Function

   Calculates the GC skew in different regions of the given genome

Description

   This program graphs the GC skew for the whole genome, coding regions,
   intergenic regions, and the third codon.
 
   G-language SOAP service is provided by the
   Institute for Advanced Biosciences, Keio University.
   The original web service is located at the following URL:
