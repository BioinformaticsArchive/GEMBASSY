Function

   Calculates and graphs the sequence conservation using information content

Description

   This function calculates and graphs the sequence conservation in regions 
   around the start/stop codons using information content.
  
   G-language SOAP service is provided by the
   Institute for Advanced Biosciences, Keio University.
   The original web service is located at the following URL:

   http://www.g-language.org/wiki/soap

   WSDL(RPC/Encoded) file is located at:

Usage

   Here is a sample session with gbaseinformationcontent

   Simply calculate information content and write out to CSV file.

% gbaseinformationcontent refseqn:NC_000913
Calculates and graphs the sequence conservation using information content
Output file [nc_000913.gbaseinformationcontent]:

   Go to the output files for this example

   Example 2

   Plot a graph with EMBOSS graphics device.

% gbaseinformationcontent -plot refseqn:NC_000913
Calculates and graphs the sequence conservation using information content
Created gbaseinformationcontent.ps

   -upstream           integer    [30] Length upstream of specified position
                                  to create PWM (Any integer value)
   -downstream         integer    [30] Length downstream of specified position
                                  to create PWM (Any integer value)
   -patlen             integer    [3] Length of oligomer to count (Any integer
                                  value)
   -accid              boolean    [N] Include to use sequence accession ID as
                                  query
   -plot               toggle     [N] Include to plot result

   General qualifiers:
   -help               boolean    Report command line options and exit. More
                                  information on associated and general
                                  qualifiers can be found with -help -verbose
