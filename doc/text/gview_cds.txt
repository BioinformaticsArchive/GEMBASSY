                                  gview_cds
Function

   Displays a graph of nucleotide contents around start and stop codons

Description

   This method creates a graph showing the average A,T,G,C contents
   around start/stop codons. This is useful to view consensus around
   start/stop codons and to find characteristic pattern in CDS.
