Function

   Calculate a measure of synonymous codon usage evenness (Ew)

Description

   gew calculates the 'weighted sum of relative entropy' (Ew) as a measure
   of synonymous codon usage evenness for each gene. This index takes all
   three aspects of amino acid usage (number of distinct amino acids,
   relatieve frequencies, and degree of codon degeneracy) into account.
