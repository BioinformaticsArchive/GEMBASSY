Function

   Calculate a measure of synonymous codon usage evenness (Ew)

Description

   This program calculates the 'weighted sum of relative entropy' (Ew) as a 
   measure of synonymous codon usage evenness for each gene.
  
   G-language SOAP service is provided by the
   Institute for Advanced Biosciences, Keio University.
   The original web service is located at the following URL:

   http://www.g-language.org/wiki/soap

   WSDL(RPC/Encoded) file is located at:

   http://soap.g-language.org/g-language.wsdl

   Documentation on G-language Genome Analysis Environment methods are
   provided at the Document Center
