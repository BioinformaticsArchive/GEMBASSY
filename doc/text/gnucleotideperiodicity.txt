                             gnucleotideperiodicity
Function

   Checks the periodicity of certain oligonucleotides

Description

   gnucleotideperiodicity checks the periodicity of certain nucleotide
   (best known with AA dinucleotide). Bacteria and archaebacteria are
   known to show periodicity of ApA dinucleotides at about 11bp and 10bp.
   Lower eukaryotes also show periodicity but higher eukaryotes do not.
