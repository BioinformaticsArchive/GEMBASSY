Function

   Prints out basic nucleotide sequence statistics

Description

   This method prints out basic compositional statistics of the 
   given nucleotide sequence. Returns the number of A, T, G, and C bases.

 
   G-language SOAP service is provided by the
   Institute for Advanced Biosciences, Keio University.
   The original web service is located at the following URL:

   http://www.g-language.org/wiki/soap

   WSDL(RPC/Encoded) file is located at:

   http://soap.g-language.org/g-language.wsdl

   Documentation on G-language Genome Analysis Environment methods are
   provided at the Document Center

Usage

   Here is a sample session with gseqinfo

% gseqinfo NC_000913.gbk
Prints out basic nucleotide sequence statistics
Output filename [nc_000913.gseqinfo]:

   Creates nc_000913.gseqinfo
