                                     gaaui
Function

   Calculates various indece of amino acid usage

Description

   gaaui calculates amino acid usage indices for proteins (excluding
   formylmethionine). Calculated indices are as follows,
      Laa:   Length in amino acids
      ndaa:  Number of different amino acids
      Haau:  Entropy of amino acid usage
      mmw:   Mean molecular weight
      gravy: Mean hydropathic indices of each amino acid
      aroma: Relative frequency of aromatic amino acids
