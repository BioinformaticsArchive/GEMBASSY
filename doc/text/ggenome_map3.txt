Function

   Draws the map of the genome (version 3)

Description

   This method creates a map of the genome, showing the local 
   nucleotide contents and positions of genes.
   A is shown in red, T is shown in green, 
   G is shown in yellow, and C is shown in blue. 
  
   G-language SOAP service is provided by the
   Institute for Advanced Biosciences, Keio University.
   The original web service is located at the following URL:
