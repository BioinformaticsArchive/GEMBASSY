                           gbase_relative_entropy
Function

   Calculates and graphs the sequence conservation using Kullback-Leibler
   divergence (relative entropy)

Description

   This function calculates and graphs the sequence conservation in regions 
   around the start/stop codons using Kullback-Leibler divergence
   (relative entropy).
