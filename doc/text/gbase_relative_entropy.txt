   -upstream           integer    [30] length upstream of specified position
                                  to create PWM (Any integer value)
   -downstream         integer    [30] length downstream of specified position
                                  to create PWM (Any integer value)
   -output             string     [g] Input 'g' for graph output, 'f' for CSV
                                  file output (Any string)
   -accid              boolean    [0] Include to use sequence accession ID as
                                  query

   General qualifiers:
   -help               boolean    Report command line options and exit. More
                                  information on associated and general
                                  qualifiers can be found with -help -verbose
