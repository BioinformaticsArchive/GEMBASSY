Function

   Calculates the codon bias index (CBI)

Description

   gcbi calculates the codon bias index (CBI) for each gene af the given
   genome. CBI is a directional codon bias which measures the usage of
   optimal codons in a gene. CBI is similar to Fop, and can take negative
   values depending on the codon usage.
