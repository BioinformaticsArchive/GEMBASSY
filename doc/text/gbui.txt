Function

   Calculates base usage indices for protein-coding sequences

Description

   This program calculates base usage indices for protein-coding sequences
   (excluding start and stop codons).



   G-language SOAP service is provided by the
   Institute for Advanced Biosciences, Keio University.
   The original web service is located at the following URL:

   http://www.g-language.org/wiki/soap

   WSDL(RPC/Encoded) file is located at:

   http://soap.g-language.org/g-language.wsdl

   Documentation on G-language Genome Analysis Environment methods are
   provided at the Document Center

   http://ws.g-language.org/gdoc/

Usage

   Here is a sample session with gbui

% gbui NC_000913.gbk
