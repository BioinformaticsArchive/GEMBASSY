Function

   Calculates base usage indices for protein-coding sequences

Description

   This program calculates base usage indices for protein-coding sequences
   (excluding start and stop codons).


   G-language SOAP service is provided by the
   Institute for Advanced Biosciences, Keio University.
   The original web service is located at the following URL:

   http://www.g-language.org/wiki/soap

   WSDL(RPC/Encoded) file is located at:

   http://soap.g-language.org/g-language.wsdl

   Documentation on G-language Genome Analysis Environment methods are
   provided at the Document Center

Usage:
    NULL = &bui(G instance);

  Options:
   -output      output option (default: 'stdout')
                'stdout' for standard output,
                'f' for file output in directory "data"
   -filename    output filename (default: 'bui.csv')
   -id          ID of a group of genes or a single gene (default: '')
   -translate   1 when translates using standard codon table (default: 0)
   -del_key     regular expression to delete key (i.e. amino acids and nucleotides)
                (default: '[^ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWYacgtU\/]')
   -position    codon position (default: '');
                '' when assessing overall base usage of the gene
                '1' when assessing base usage at 1st position of codons
                '2' when assessing base usage at 2nd position of codons
                '3' when assessing base
