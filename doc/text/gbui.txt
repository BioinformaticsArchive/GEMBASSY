Function

   Calculates base usage indices for protein-coding sequences

Description

   This program calculates base usage indices for protein-coding sequences
   (excluding start and stop codons), and inputs in the G instance.
   Informations stored in the G instance are:
    acgt: total number of bases (A+T+G+C)
    ryr: purine/pyrimidine ratio (A+G)/(T+C)
    gac: G+A content (G+A)/(A+T+G+C)
    gcc: G+C content (G+C)/(A+T+G+C)
    gtc: G+T content (G+T)/(A+T+G+C)
    gcs: GC skew (G-C)/(G+C)
    tas: TA skew (T-A)/(T+A)
    Hbu: entropy of base usage

   This program downloads the result file to the working directory.
   The downloaded file is named "gbui.csv".

   G-language SOAP service is provided by the
   Institute for Advanced Biosciences, Keio University.
   The original web service is located at the following URL:

   http://www.g-language.org/wiki/soap

   WSDL(RPC/Encoded) file is located at:

   http://soap.g-language.org/g-language.wsdl

   Documentation on G-language Genome Analysis Environment methods are
   provided at the Document Center
