Function

   Calculate the gene strand bias of the given genome

Description

   ggeneskew calculates and plots the strand bias of genes (or the GC skew
   within them). By default, this program visualizes the gene strand preference
   (1 for direct, -1 for complement strand), but by specifying -base option
   option, GC/AT/Purine/Keto skews of the coding regions or more specifically
   in the GC3 (third codon position) with -gctri option can be calculated.
