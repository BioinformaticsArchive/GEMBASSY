Function

   Calculate the gene strand bias of the given genome

Description

   This program calculates and graphs the strand bias of genes (or the GC skew
   within them). By default, this program visualizes the gene strand preference
   (1 for direct, -1 for complement strand), but by specifying -base option
   option, GC/AT/Purine/Keto skews of the coding regions or more specifically in
   the GC3 (third codon position) with -gc3 option can be calculated.
