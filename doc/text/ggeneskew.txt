Function

   Calculate the gene strand bias of the given genome

Description

   This program calculates and graphs the strand bias of genes (or the GC skew
   within them). By default, this program visualizes the gene strand
   preference (1 for direct, -1 for complement strand), but by specifying
   -base option, GC/AT/Purine/Keto skews of the coding regions or more
   specifically in the GC3 (third codon position) with -gctri option can be
   calculated.

   This program downloads the result file to the working directory.
   The downloaded file is named "ggcwin.png" or "ggcwin.csv"
   according to the -output option.

   G-language SOAP service is provided by the
   Institute for Advanced Biosciences, Keio University.
