   GC Skew Index: an index for strand-specefic mutational bias

Description

   This program calculates the GC Skew Index (GCSI) of the given circular
   bacterial genome. GCSI quantifies the degree of GC Skew. In other words,
   this index represents the degree of strand-specific mutational bias in 
   bacterial genomes, caused by replicational selection. 

   GCSI is calculated by the following formula:
   GCSI = sqrt((SA/6000) * (dist/600))
   where SA is the spectral amplitude of Fourier power spectrum at 1Hz,
   and dist is the normalized Euclidean distance between the vertices of 
   cumulative GC skew.

   GCSI ranges from 0 (no observable skew) to 1 (strong skew), and Archaeal
   genomes that have multiple replication origins and therefore have no
   observable skew mostly have GCSI below 0.05. Escherichia coli genome has
   values around 0.10.

   Version 1 of GCSI required fixed number of windows (4096), but the new GCSI
   version 2 (also known as generalized GCSI: gGCSI) is invariant of the number
   of windows. GCSI version 1 is calculated as an arithmetic mean (as opposed to 
   the geometric mean of gGCSI) of SR (spectral ratio, the signal-to-noise ratio
   of 1Hz power spectrum) and dist.
