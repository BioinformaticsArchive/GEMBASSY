Function

   GC Skew Index: an index for strand-specific mutational bias

Description

   ggcsi calculates the GC Skew Index (GCSI) of the given circular bacterial
   genome. GCSI quantifies the degree of GC Skew. In other words, this index
   represents the degree of strand-specific mutational bias in bacterial
   genomes, caused by replicational selection. 
   GCSI is calculated by the following formula:

      GCSI = sqrt((SA/6000) * (dist/600))

   where SA is the spectral amplitude of Fourier power spectrum at 1Hz,
   and dist is the normalized Euclidean distance between the vertices of 
   cumulative GC skew.

   GCSI ranges from 0 (no observable skew) to 1 (strong skew), and Archaeal
   genomes that have multiple replication origins and therefore have no
   observable skew mostly have GCSI below 0.05. Escherichia coli genome has
   values around 0.10.

   Version 1 of GCSI required fixed number of windows (4096), but the new GCSI
   version 2 (also known as generalized GCSI: gGCSI) is invariant of the number
   of windows. GCSI version 1 is calculated as an arithmetic mean (as opposed
   to the geometric mean of gGCSI) of SR (spectral ratio, the signal-to-noise
   ratio of 1Hz power spectrum) and dist.
